# Final Year Project
Submitted in partial fulfillment of requirements for a Bachelors Degree in IT.


The Idea behind this project was simply to have a medium,to report road accidents.
Taking advantage of the technology smartphones had to offer,this solution for reporting road accidents inlcuded details like the location to the scene and the kind of accident(s).
This message was then sent to a web server,that ideally was situated on the premises of the responsible agencies or a web server that these agencies had access to.

Thus giving the response team adequate information.
